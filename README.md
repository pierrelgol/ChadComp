# ChadComp

Chad comp is a project of mine of writting a real C99 compiler from stractch, using nothing but C code. Ultimately this project will be ported to even Chader Zig code.

This project sole purpose is to learn how a compiler is working. This compiler will be hand written entirely, no flex, yacc, or soyboy clang llvm backend. It will probably be horrible. But only real chad can understand the need for a man to make his own C compiler.
