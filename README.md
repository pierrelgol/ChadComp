# CCompiler

This is a project that I'm going to use as an excuse to learn zig, and how to
use zig to build a micro functionnning C compiler. No idea when it's going to be
ready but here we go.

I will start by writting a functionning C compiler in C from scratch using
nothing but standard library functions. Then I will do the same in zig and
I will compare how easy it is for each language, as well as the speed of both
compilers.
